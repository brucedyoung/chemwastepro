Chemical Waste Management Program

This is intended to help a small hazardous generator facility track the management, storage and shipment of chemical waste to disposal facilites.

It is based on the functions on a well-developed closed-system, but updated to use modern web technologies. 

DO NOT USE. IT IS NOT IN A DEPLOYABLE STATE. I'm working on it every day.
